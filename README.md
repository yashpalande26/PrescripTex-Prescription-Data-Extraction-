# PrescripTex-Prescription-Data-Extraction

I spearheaded an innovative and transformative medical data extraction project that revolutionized the way PDF prescriptions were processed. The project's primary objective was to convert PDF prescriptions into enhanced images, thereby enabling precise text extractionâ€”a critical advancement in the healthcare industry.

To achieve this, I harnessed the power of cutting-edge technologies such as PyTesseract and OpenCV, combined with the flexibility of regular expressions. These tools formed the core of our solution, allowing us to effectively extract vital information from prescriptions.

The key components of this project included:

1. PDF to Enhanced Images: We implemented a robust process to convert PDF prescriptions into enhanced images. This step was crucial in preparing the documents for accurate text extraction.

2. Text Extraction: Leveraging PyTesseract and OpenCV, we developed a sophisticated text extraction mechanism. This process involved parsing through the images to meticulously extract patient details, medication information, and directions provided by healthcare professionals.

3. Data Presentation: The extracted data was thoughtfully organized and presented in JSON format. This format facilitated easy integration with various healthcare systems and databases, streamlining the use of prescription data.

4. Accuracy Enhancement: Our project aimed at significantly improving accuracy levels in medical data extraction. By developing expertise in computer vision and data processing techniques, we fine-tuned our algorithms to ensure the highest level of precision.

This project stands as a testament to our commitment to innovation in healthcare data processing. By seamlessly converting PDF prescriptions into structured data, I not only enhanced the efficiency of healthcare systems but also improved patient care through more accurate and timely information.

The project enabled me to deepen my expertise in computer vision, data extraction, and data presentation while addressing a critical need within the medical field.
